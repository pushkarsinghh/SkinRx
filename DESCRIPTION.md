# SkinRx: AI Dermatology Assistant

## Inspiration

In India, access to specialized healthcare like dermatology is a luxury many can't afford. The dermatologist-to-patient ratio is critically low, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, with estimates as high as one dermatologist for every 100,000 people. Many individuals let skin conditions worsen due to a lack of immediate, accessible advice, often facing language barriers or the inability to travel.

With the rise of powerful multimodal AI, like Google's Gemini, we saw an opportunityâ€”not to replace doctors, but to bridge this gap. Our goal: build an AI-powered companion that delivers preliminary dermatological information to every Indian, in a language they understand.

## What It Does

**SkinRx** is a multi-lingual AI Dermatology Assistant that guides users from concern to care in three simple steps:

1. **Analyze:**  
    Users upload an image of their skin concern. The app uses the Gemini API for instant visual analysis, identifying the potential condition, its severity, and providing a detailed description.

2. **Understand & Discuss:**  
    The analysis is presented in a clean, accessible interface. Users can:
    - **Translate:** Instantly switch the report to Hindi.
    - **Listen:** Use Text-to-Speech to have results read aloud, breaking literacy barriers.
    - **Chat:** Ask follow-up questions in a conversational AI chat to better understand the condition and remedies.

3. **Act & Connect:**  
    SkinRx helps users locate nearby dermatologists, closing the loop between AI insight and professional care.

## How We Built It

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React) for high-performance, server-rendered UX.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive UI development.
- **Core AI Logic:** Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20) powers:
  - Multimodal analysis for diagnosis.
  - Structured JSON output via prompt engineering.
  - Natural language processing for translation and chat.
- **Accessibility:** Browser's native Web Speech API for Text-to-Speech, ensuring broad compatibility.

## Challenges

- **Prompt Engineering:** Ensuring the AI consistently returns a perfectly structured JSON object, especially for translation, required significant iteration and precise instructions.
- **User Experience:** Managing multiple asynchronous API calls (analysis, translation, chat) and ensuring smooth UI updates with React's useEffect and state management.

## Accomplishments

- Built a complete end-to-end solution guiding users from initial concern to actionable professional help.
- Focused on true accessibility: multi-language support (Hindi) and Text-to-Speech make SkinRx usable by a wider demographic, including those facing digital or literacy barriers.

## What We Learned

- The power of LLMs lies in creative, precise prompt engineering.
- Human-centered AI is essential: technology should solve real-world problems empathetically. Features like translation and TTS were designed with user needs first.

## What's Next

- **Low-Bandwidth "Lite" Mode:** Ensure reliability on slower mobile networks.
- **Public Health Dashboard:** Aggregate anonymized data to create a real-time heatmap of skin conditions across India.
- **Telemedicine Integration:** Enable appointment booking and initial consultations through the app.
- **Expanded Language Support:** Add more regional languages (Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi).
- **Historical Tracking:** Allow users to track condition progress over time and share with their doctor.
